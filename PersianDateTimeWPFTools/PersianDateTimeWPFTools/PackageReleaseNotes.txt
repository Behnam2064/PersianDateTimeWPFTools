✨ New Feature: DayMetadata (Unified Per-Day Customization)

This release introduces a new DayMetadata API that allows full control over individual calendar days using a single, unified model.

Key highlights:
- New CalendarDayInfo model for describing per-day behavior
- Centralized configuration for tooltips, indicators, and disabled days
- Backward-compatible with existing DayToolTips and DayIndicators APIs
- Tooltips can be displayed even on disabled days to explain restrictions
- Virtualization-safe implementation ensures correct behavior when navigating between months
- Fully styleable and MVVM-friendly design

This enhancement makes advanced day-level customization cleaner, more expressive, and easier to maintain.
